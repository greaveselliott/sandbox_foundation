# My initial sandbox environment for a website based on Foundation

Pre-requisite :

you will need node installed
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
once you have node installed 
Just run 'npm install' to install all dependant packages

In a nutshell
Copy the folder to a directory
navigate to that directory in the terminal
and type 'grunt'
grunt will compile the sass and watch for any changes


It also includes some JS libraries I find useful but you may want to delete those
